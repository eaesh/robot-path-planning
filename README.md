# Path Planning For Disc Robot with Soft Subdivision Search and Voronoi Heuristic
**Melissa Lopez & Eshan Saran**

**Final Project for *Robotics* course at NYU, Spring 2017 by Professor Chee Yap**
**Last Updated: Monday, May 15**

**TO RUN THIS PROGRAM**
1. Navigate to robot-path-planning-mater in MATLAB
2. Type "GUI" into the Command Window in MATLAB
3. The interface will appear.
4. To interact with the interface, the program will take a text
    file in the form "envX.txt", where X is a number 0-5, for which we have
    provided sample environment files.
5. After selecting an environment, you can select "Show Environment."
6. After the environment is displayed, you can run HW4 SSS or Voronoi SSS.
7. Select "Show Path" once an algorithm has finished to see a final result.

Once an environment has been selected, the user may show the environment,
show the subdivisions made by the SSS algorithms, then display the path
taken by the robot.
